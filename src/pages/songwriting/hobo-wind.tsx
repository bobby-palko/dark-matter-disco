          <li>song is more present tense, they don't work for this song</li>

            <ul>
              <li>wind singing hymns</li>
              <li>could work, especially tied with sin!</li>

            Whim, Swim

              <li>Swimming through the trees</li>
              <li>
                But if wind is a singer, shouldn't be swimming while it's
                singing (In case you want to get out of 'Hymn' idea)

      Finding Hymn, notion of singing and wind singing, now feels like the spine

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Hi wind, I wonder what your experiences have been, in the song that
          you carry with you, and can I sing along?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Never would've happened without using rhyming dictionary and family
            table to find Hymn

      <li>

          <li>creates unstable rhyme type</li>

      <li>
        Assonance rhyme (same vowel sound, different consonants)

          <li>Drift</li>
        </ul>

        Consonant rhyme (same consonant sound)

      <li>don't need to write down EVERY rhyme</li>

    <p>Lines are always provisional!</p>
    <p>Want them to:</p>
    <ul>

      </li>
      <li>
        don't match rhythm
        <ul>
          <li>another three stressed line, stopping on third stress?</li>
          <li>cutting second line off, forward motion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="third-line">Third Line</h4>
    <p>
      Third line match first gives expectation that second line is going to be
      matched

            <ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Why? there are no rules!</li>

        if you didn't match, it would be statement/variation
        <ul>
          <li>keeps it “going wherever we wanna go”</li>
          <li>
            when it comes to the bridge and last verse, we haven’t gone

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        matching rhythm and rhyme is statement/repetition (AABA)
        <ul>
          <li>
            keeping the same, and then bridge is someplace different, builds
            tension
          </li>
          <li>
            returning to third verse feels like coming home
            <ul>
              <li>even more power returning to familiar territory</li>
              <li>especially since big idea is in third box</li>

    <h2 id="melodic-rhythm">Melodic Rhythm</h2>
    <p>how will your lyrics fit rhythmically within the song?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>figure out rhythm before actual melody </li>
      <li>
        could just use a metronome, or few chord loop
        <ul>
          <li>doesn't need to be the chords you're going to use</li>
          <li>could use temp chords to get feel of song</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>how are the syllables going to fit into the sequence?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>remember to set stressed syllables on stressed beats!</li>
      <li>
        mess with note values as well
        <ul>
          <li>hold notes long or keep them shorter?</li>
          <li>
            mix it up! instead of all half time or all normal speed, try doing
            different note values{' '}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that we have note values, we can think about bridge</p>

      <li>
        bridge is contrast with what we have already
        <ul>
          <li>what have i got? (note values)</li>
          <li>
            whats different than that?!
            <ul>
              <li>use these!</li>
              <li>
                bridge should be unstable usually, want it to move into the next
                section

    <p>Key you play in (in scale of key) has stable and unstable tones</p>
    <p>
      Stable tones (in order of most stable to least stable, of the stable
      tones):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tonic (root note)</li>
      <li>Octave</li>
      <li>5th</li>
      <li>3rd</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unstable, feeling of wanting to move, want to resolve, creates tension:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2nd - wants to move to tonic (or 9th)</li>
      <li>4th - wants to move to 3rd</li>
      <li>6th - wants to move to 5th</li>
      <li>7th - wants to move to octave</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What happens when tones relative to one chord hit chord change? (Am &gt;
      G)

      <li>G is down one whole step</li>

      <li>
        First thing is to make melody as good as possible before worrying about
        harmony/chords
        <ul>
          <li>Big moment first</li>
          <li>
            in this song? The word WIND

              <li>find the note that works best</li>
              <li>Here it's the 9th</li>
              <li>unstable but feels close to home (tonic)</li>
              <li>
                Don't hit this note really before we get to the big moment
              </li>
              <li>like stealing it's thunder</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>After this, worry about the others</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Think like song
        <ul>
          <li>
            active thing talking about? active melody
            <ul>

            kinda stuck? Static
