      <Heading headingType="section">Phrasing</Heading>
      <p>Phrase that starts on downbeat of bar, front-heavy:</p>
      <List>
        <li>
          weight of line in front of the line. strongest, brightest light (the
          downbeat)
        </li>
        <li>
          Has to do with the strongest stressed syllable falling on the
          strongest beat
        </li>
        <li>Front-heavy lines are stable</li>
      </List>
      <p>Phrase that starts after the downbeat of the bar, back-heavy:</p>
      <List>
        <li>weight of line is in the back‚Ä¶duh</li>
        <li>is 'in motion' therefore unstable</li>
      </List>
      <p>
        Create contrast to emphasize one or the other. Front-heavy line before a
        back-heavy line to really make it feel more emotional
      </p>
    </Card>
    <Card>
      <Heading headingType="section">Time Signature Weight</Heading>
      <p>4/4 time is always Strongest, Weak, Strong, Weak</p>
      <List>
        <li>Quarter notes define this</li>
        <li>16th notes? Still Swsw</li>
        <li>Half notes? Sw|sw</li>
        <li>Whole notes? S|w|s|w</li>
      </List>
      <p>Starting lines in second bar?</p>
      <List>
        <li>count in half time, it starts on 3 (1,2|3,4)</li>
        <li>still back heavy phrasing</li>
      </List>
      <p>Still works in 3/4!!</p>
      <List>
        <li>Strong, 2, 3, Weak, 2, 3, Strong 2, 3, Weak, 2, 3</li>
      </List>
      <p>
        So starting on the downbeat on the weak bar would be weak, but not as
        weak as starting back-heavy in a weak bar
